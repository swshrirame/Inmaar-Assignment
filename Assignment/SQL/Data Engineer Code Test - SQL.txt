and 7 rows (one row per day in the date range). Provide the query and then using your query
result, provide answers to the following questions.

Query:
    SELECT redemptionDate, redemptionCount
    FROM tblRedemptionsByDay rbd
    JOIN tblRetailers r ON r.id = rbd.retailerId
    WHERE r.retailerName = 'ABC Store'
    AND redemptionDate BETWEEN '2023-10-30' AND '2023-11-05'
    AND rbd.createDateTime = (
        SELECT MAX(createDateTime)
        FROM tblRedemptionsByDay
        WHERE retailerId = rbd.retailerId
        AND redemptionDate = rbd.redemptionDate
    )
    ORDER BY redemptionDate;
